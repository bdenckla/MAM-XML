    "<i>Miqra According to the Masorah</i> (MAM) is a digital Hebrew "
    "edition of the Tanakh based on the Aleppo Codex and related "
    "manuscripts. It is designed for readers, and as such it contains added "
    "elements to aid "
    "vocalization of the text. For instance: When an accent is marked in an "
    "unstressed syllable, an extra accent is added in the proper place "
    "(<i>pashta</i>, <i>zarqa</i>, <i>segol</i>, <i>telisha</i>). "
    "<i>Legarmeih</i> and <i>paseq</i> are visibly distinguished. <i>Qamaz "
    "qatan</i> is indicated by its designated Unicode character "
    "(alternatives are documented where traditions differ about its "
    "application).<br>The text "
    'of MAM is fully documented. The <a href="' + _INTRODUCTION_URL + '">complete '
    "introduction</a> to the edition (Hebrew) explains the types of "
    "editorial decisions that have been made and the reasons for them (<a "
    'href="' + _ENGLISH_ABSTRACT + '">English '
    "abstract</a>). In addition, every word in the Bible about which there "
    "is some textual concern or ambiguity includes a documentation note; "
    "these "
    'notes can be viewed conveniently <a href="'

    'If an error is discovered, it may be reported to <a href="'
