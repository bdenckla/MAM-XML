# MAM-XML
This repo has an extract of MAM in an XML format that is simple but not complete. See:
* `out/xml-vtrad-bhs` for files in this XML format that use BHS versification
* `out/xml-vtrad-sef` for files in this XML format that use Sefaria versification

This repo also has a program, `py/main_mam4sef.py`,
that is an example of how the XML can be used.
This program uses the XML to create the Sefaria-format (CSV/HTML) version of MAM.
