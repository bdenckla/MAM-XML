# MAM-XML
This repo has an extract of MAM in an XML format that is simple but not complete. See:
* `out/xml-vtrad-bhs` for files in this XML format that use BHS versification
* `out/xml-vtrad-sef` for files in this XML format that use Sefaria versification

This repo also has a program, `py/main_mam4sef.py`,
that is an example of how the XML can be used.
This program uses the XML to create the Sefaria-format (CSV/HTML) version of MAM.

The source of this data is the
[MAM Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mkQyj6by1AtBUabpbaxaZq9Z2X3pX8ZpwG91ZCSOEYs/edit#gid=920165745).

Other versions/formats of MAM (each with their tradeoffs) include:

* [MAM-XML](https://github.com/bdenckla/MAM-XML)
* [MAM for Sefaria](https://github.com/bdenckla/MAM-for-Sefaria)
