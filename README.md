# MAM-XML
This repo has an extract of MAM in an XML format that is simple but not complete. See out/xml.

In addition to the XML in out/xml, this repo has a program, py/main_mam4sef.py, that is an example of how the XML can be used. In this program, the XML is used to create the Sefaria-format (CSV/HTML) version of MAM.
