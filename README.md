# MAM-XML
This repo has MAM in an XML format that is simple but not complete. See out/xml.

This format was originally intended for use by STEPBible. But now, for STEPBible, I will try to directly generate OSIS-compliant XML. (This repository used to be called MAM-for-STEPBible.)

In addition to the XML in out/xml, this repo has a program, main_mam_xml_test.py, that is an example of how the XML can be used. In this example program, the XML is used to create a Sefaria-style CSV/XML version of MAM. (It differs only from the real "MAM for Sefaria" by having BHS versification (verse numbering).)
